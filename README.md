# Audio Plugin Template

## Overview


`PluginTemplate` is a C++ project template designed for developing and testing audio VST plugins. It contains a CMake project located in the "plugin" folder, which utilizes the [JUCE](https://juce.com/) framework. Testing is facilitated by a "test" project that integrates the [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) framework. Both JUCE and GoogleTest are installed automatically during the initial build using CMake's CPM package manager if they aren't already available on your system. 

This template serves as a streamlined starting point for creating audio plugins and includes a top-level CMake build script along with a Python script for automating the build process.

## Features

- **Modern C++**: Leverages the C++20 standard for optimized and robust code.
- **JUCE Framework Integration**: Offers seamless integration with JUCE for efficient audio plugin development.
- **Unit Testing with GoogleTest**: Supports unit testing with the GoogleTest framework.
- **Package Management with CPM**: Facilitates easy inclusion and installation of packages via CPM.
- **Cross-Platform CMake Build System**: Uses CMake for consistent, cross-platform build configuration.
- **Automated Build Script**: A Python script to simplify setup and build processes.
- **Visual Studio Compatibility**: Configured for Visual Studio 2022, but can be adjusted in the Python script.

## Prerequisites

- **CMake**: Version 3.25 or higher.
- **Python**: Version 3.x (for running `build.py`).
- **Visual Studio**: 2022 (the project uses the Visual Studio 17 generator).

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository including:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Diversiam90815/Plugin-Template.git
```

### Build Instructions

#### 1. Prepare the Build Environment

Before building the project, you need to generate the necessary build files using CMake. This can be done using the `build.py` script with the `--prepare` or `-p` option.

```bash
cd PluginTemplate
python build.py --prepare
```

**Note**: By default, this prepares the project for a Release build. If you wish to prepare for a Debug build, include the `--debug` or `-d` option:

```bash
python build.py --prepare --debug
```

This sets up the build environment for a Debug configuration.

#### 2. Build the Project

To build the project, use the `--build` or `-b` option:

```bash
python build.py --build
```

This will compile the project using the build files generated during the preparation step.

- **Release Build**: By default, the build is configured for a Release build.
- **Debug Build**: To build the project in Debug mode, include the `--debug` or `-d` option:

  ```bash
  python build.py --build --debug
  ```

**Important**: If you did not run the `--prepare` step separately, the script will automatically prepare the build environment before building.

#### 3. Combined Preparation and Build

You can combine preparation and building in a single command. This is useful if you want to ensure that your build environment is up-to-date before compiling.

- **Release Build**:

  ```bash
  python build.py --prepare --build
  ```

- **Debug Build**:

  ```bash
  python build.py --prepare --build --debug
  ```

In both cases, including the `--debug` or `-d` option switches the configuration to Debug mode.

### Running the Plugin

After a successful build, the application can be found in the build output directory. Currently, the audio plugin is set to build VST3 and standalone executable binaries. They can be found within the respective folder.


## Project Structure

- `cmake/` - Contains CMake files:
  - `cpm.cmake` - Installing the currently latest version of CMake's package manager CPM into the Lib folder.

- `plugin/` - Containing the JUCE audio plugin project.
  - `CMakeLists.txt` - CMake project for the JUCE audio plugin.
  - `source/` - Contains the source code:
    - `PluginProcessor.cpp` - The main processing code for the plugin.
    - `PluginEditor.cpp` - The GUI editor for the plugin.
  - `include/` - Contains the include (header) files:
    - `PluginProcessor.h` - The main processing code for the plugin.
    - `PluginEditor.h` - The GUI editor for the plugin.
    - `Parameters.h` - Definitions for plugin parameters.

- `test/` - Containing the GoogleTest project.
  - `CMakeLists.txt` - CMake project for the GoogleTest.
  - `source/` - Contains the source code:
    - `ProcessorTest.cpp` - A template for writing unit test for the PluginProcessor.
    
- `CMakeLists.txt` - The top-level CMake build configuration file.
- `build.py` - Python script to automate build preparation and compilation.
- `Project.h.in` - CMake configures this during compliation and sets project specific data that can be used project-wide.
- `.clang-format` - Containing uniform format rules for the C++ code. See "Code Formatting with Clang-Format". 
- `ReadMe.md` - Project documentation (this file).


## Build Script (`build.py`) Details

The `build.py` script automates setup and compilation with several key features:

- **Automatic Directory Management**: Automatically switches to the correct working directory and restores it afterward.
- **System Command Execution**: Runs system commands with error handling.
- **Build Preparation**: Generates build files with CMake, using the specified generator (`Visual Studio 17`). The `--debug` option sets the `TARGET_CONFIG` to `Debug` (default is `Release`).
- **Build Execution**: Option to clean previous builds and compile the project.
- **Command-Line Arguments**:
  - `-p`, `--prepare`: Prepares the project for building or IDE usage.
    - Example: `python build.py --prepare` (Release build)
  - `-b`, `--build`: Builds the project.
    - Example: `python build.py --build` (Release build)
  - `-d`, `--debug`: Sets the configuration to Debug mode, usable with `--prepare` and `--build`.
  - `-v`, `--version`: Prints the installed CMake and Python versions.

### Script Usage Examples

- **Print out the current version of CMake and Python installed**:

  ```bash
  python build.py --version 
  ```

- **Prepare the Project for Release Build**:

  ```bash
  python build.py --prepare
  ```

- **Prepare the Project for Debug Build**:

  ```bash
  python build.py --prepare --debug
  ```

- **Build the Project in Release Mode**:

  ```bash
  python build.py --build
  ```

- **Build the Project in Debug Mode**:

  ```bash
  python build.py --build --debug
  ```

- **Prepare and Build the Project in Release Mode**:

  ```bash
  python build.py --prepare --build
  ```

- **Prepare and Build the Project in Debug Mode**:

  ```bash
  python build.py --prepare --build --debug
  ```

**Note**: The `--debug` or `-d` option affects both preparation and building steps. If you include it, both steps will use the Debug configuration.


## Code Formatting with Clang-Format

This project includes a `.clang-format` file that defines the code style guidelines for consistent formatting across the codebase. You can automatically format your code according to these standards using your editor's shortcut.

### How to Use

- **In Visual Studio (or compatible editors on macOS):**
  - Open the file you wish to format.
  - Press `Cmd + K`, then `Cmd + D` to auto-format the current file using the predefined style.

This will format your code based on the rules specified in the `.clang-format` file, ensuring consistency and improving code readability.


## Customization

You can customize the project by modifying:

- **Plugin Information**: Update the company name, manufacturer code, plugin code, and product name in `CMakeLists.txt`.
- **JUCE Modules**: Enable or disable JUCE modules as needed.
- **Source Code**: Implement your plugin logic in `PluginProcessor.cpp` and design your GUI in `PluginEditor.cpp`.
